# Jui Roy — Project Portfolio

This repository summarizes my research, coursework projects, and publications in energy systems, microgrids, and solar engineering.

## 🔬 Internship 
1) Final-Year Internship – Feb–Aug 2025, Louisiana Solar Energy Lab, University of Louisiana at Lafayette
  Designed and evaluated three grid-tied PV systems (1 commercial, 2 residential) using PVWatts and ASHRAE data
•	Performed techno-economic assessment (LCOE, payback period, energy offset) and validated electrical and structural compliance per NEC/ASCE.
•	Recommended integration of battery storage and smart control for future enhancements.

2️⃣ Summer Research Internship – Louisiana Solar Energy Lab  
3) Summer Research Internship - June-Sept 2024  Louisiana Solar Energy Lab, University of Louisiana at Lafayette
•	Supported design and simulation of floating PV systems in Louisiana through site selection and impact analysis.
•	Conducted mechanical and electrical safety reviews for ground-mounted PV installations.
•	Compared the financial and technical feasibility of floating vs. ground PV installations using SAM and PVSyst.

4) Research Intern – EECONE Project: European ECOsystem for Green Electronics Grenoble Institute of Technology, Grenoble, France- Feb – May 2024
•	Contributed to CO2 emissions reduction initiatives through green electronics methodologies, supporting the 6R concept in sustainable design.
•	Collaborated with cross-functional teams to address e-waste management and align project goals with the Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan.

## 📚 Coursework Projects
1) Modeling and Power-Flow Analysis of a Solar-Integrated Three-Phase Network (EECE 450 Project)
2) Sensor Anomaly Detection and Forecasting for Operational Visibility (Machine Learning Project: Solar Irradiance)
3) PV System Design & Cost Analysis (Residential and commertial)

## 📄 Publications
1)Roy, J., Bentley, R. P., Chambers, T., et al. “Field Development of a Flexible Research Microgrid – What We Learned and Future Roadmap.” IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC) 2026 — Accepted for presentation and publication

•	Contributed to documenting field development and commissioning lessons for a hybrid AC/DC research microgrid enabling grid-connected operation and intentional islanding experiments relevant to resilient distribution operation.
•	Supported description of microgrid architecture and DER integration (PV, solar thermal, gas generation, BESS, EV charging) and ETAP digital-twin–driven supervisory control, framing monitoring and control validation in terms of operational visibility and controllability.
