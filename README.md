# Jui Roy — Project Portfolio

This repository showcases the technical projects and engineering experience I have developed through coursework, research, and applied system design. It highlights practical problem solving in power system modeling, microgrid design, PV system evaluation, and machine learning applications. The work presented here demonstrates my ability to carry projects from concept through analysis and documentation.

## 🔬 Internship 
1) 1. [Final-Year Internship – Feb–Aug 2025, Louisiana Solar Energy Lab](internship/final-year-internship)
  Designed and evaluated three grid-tied PV systems (1 commercial, 2 residential) using PVWatts and ASHRAE data
•	Performed techno-economic assessment (LCOE, payback period, energy offset) and validated electrical and structural compliance per NEC/ASCE.
•	Recommended integration of battery storage and smart control for future enhancements.


2) 2. [Summer Internship – June–Sept 2024, Louisiana Solar Energy Lab](internship/summer-internship)
•	Supported design and simulation of floating PV systems in Louisiana through site selection and impact analysis.
•	Conducted mechanical and electrical safety reviews for ground-mounted PV installations.
•	Compared the financial and technical feasibility of floating vs. ground PV installations using SAM and PVSyst.



3) 3. [Research Intern – EECONE Project, Grenoble Institute of Technology (Feb–May 2024)](internship/internship/research-intern-eecone)
•	Contributed to CO2 emissions reduction initiatives through green electronics methodologies, supporting the 6R concept in sustainable design.
•	Collaborated with cross-functional teams to address e-waste management and align project goals with the Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan.
