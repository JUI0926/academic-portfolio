# Jui Roy — Project Portfolio

This repository summarizes my research, coursework projects, and publications in energy systems, microgrids, and solar engineering.

## 🔬 Internship 
1) Final-Year Internship – Feb–Aug 2025, Louisiana Solar Energy Lab, University of Louisiana at Lafayette
  Designed and evaluated three grid-tied PV systems (1 commercial, 2 residential) using PVWatts and ASHRAE data
•	Performed techno-economic assessment (LCOE, payback period, energy offset) and validated electrical and structural compliance per NEC/ASCE.
•	Recommended integration of battery storage and smart control for future enhancements.

2) Summer Research Internship - June-Sept 2024  Louisiana Solar Energy Lab, University of Louisiana at Lafayette
•	Supported design and simulation of floating PV systems in Louisiana through site selection and impact analysis.
•	Conducted mechanical and electrical safety reviews for ground-mounted PV installations.
•	Compared the financial and technical feasibility of floating vs. ground PV installations using SAM and PVSyst.
